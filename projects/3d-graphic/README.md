# Graphical 3D image

## Description üìñ

The project is the tool that can visualize an 3D image presented in the simple format, where each dot on the map represents the hights of the point.

It is possible to move, rotate, zoom and choose different projections of the image.

## Useful notes üìù

Following issues still left
* ‚ö†Ô∏è graphic library is not in the project, because should be preinstalled
* ‚ö†Ô∏è issue with color during rotation
* ‚ö†Ô∏è perspective projection doesn't work properly for big images
* ‚ö†Ô∏è if there is a space at the end of the line, it is considered as an additional point on the map (map validity)
* ‚ö†Ô∏è width of the map is assumed based on the last line of the map, essentially assuming that all lines of the same length (map validity)
