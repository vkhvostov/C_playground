# C Programming Projects

A collection of fundamental C programming projects focusing on systems programming, standard library implementation, and graphics.

## Projects

1. [Libft](projects/libft/README.md) - A custom C library implementing essential functions from the standard library, including string manipulation, memory management, and linked list utilities.
1. [ft_printf](projects/ft_printf/README.md) - A recreation of the printf function supporting core format specifiers (%c, %s, %p, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X) with proper memory management.
1. [get_next_line](projects/get_next_line/README.md) - A line-reading function that efficiently handles file I/O and memory management, supporting multiple file descriptors simultaneously.
1. [pipex](projects/pipex/README.md) - A program that simulates shell pipes, executing command chains and redirecting input/output between processes using system calls.
1. [3d-graphic](projects/3d-graphic/README.md) - A 3D wireframe rendering program that creates isometric and perspective projections of terrain maps with interactive controls for rotation, zoom, and color.
1. [sort_algorithm](projects/sort_algorithm/README.md) - A kind of stack-based sorting program. It sorts integer sequences using only stack operations (push, swap, rotate, reverse rotate), with efficient algorithms for both small and large input sets.
